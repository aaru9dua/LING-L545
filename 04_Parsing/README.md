# Relative word order study

This Python script analyzes the relative word order of verbs and objects in different languages using Universal Dependencies treebanks. It reads data from CoNLL-U formatted treebanks and calculates the percentage of sentences where the verb precedes the object (VO) and the percentage where the object precedes the verb (OV).

The script uses Universal Dependencies treebanks for different languages. The file paths for these treebanks are specified in the treebank_files dictionary in the script
