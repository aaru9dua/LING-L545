Evolutionary methods try to simulate what an anarchist society might be like, but revolutionary tactics, which have historically taken a violent turn, aim to overthrow authority and the state. Many facets of human civilization have been influenced by anarchist theory, critique, and praxis.\\nEtymology, terminology, and definition.\\nThe etymological origin of \"anarchism\" is from the Ancient Greek \"anarkhia\", meaning \"without a ruler\", composed of the prefix \"an-\" (\"without\") and the word \"arkhos\" (\"leader\" or \"ruler\"). The suffix \"-ism\" denotes the ideological current that favours anarchy. \"Anarchism\" appears in English from 1642 as \"anarchisme\" and \"anarchy\" from 1539; early English usages emphasised a sense of disorder. Various factions within the French Revolution labelled their opponents as \"anarchists\", although few such accused shared many views with later anarchists. Many revolutionaries of the 19th century such as William Godwin (1756–1836) and Wilhelm Weitling (1808–1871) would contribute to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation but did not use \"anarchist\" or \"anarchism\" in describing themselves or their beliefs.\\nThe first political philosopher to call himself an \"anarchist\" () was Pierre-Joseph Proudhon (1809–1865), marking the formal birth of anarchism in the mid-19th century. Since the 1890s and beginning in France, \"libertarianism\" has often been used as a synonym for anarchism and its use as a synonym is still common outside the United States. Some usages of \"libertarianism\" refer to individualistic free-market philosophy only, and free-market anarchism in particular is termed \"libertarian anarchism\".\\nWhile the term \"libertarian\" has been largely synonymous with anarchism, its meaning has more recently been diluted by wider adoption from ideologically disparate groups, including both the New Left and libertarian Marxists, who do not associate themselves with authoritarian socialists or a vanguard party, and extreme cultural liberals, who are primarily concerned with civil liberties. Additionally, some anarchists use \"libertarian socialist\" to avoid anarchism\\'s negative connotations and emphasise its connections with socialism. \"Anarchism\" is broadly used to describe the anti-authoritarian w'"
